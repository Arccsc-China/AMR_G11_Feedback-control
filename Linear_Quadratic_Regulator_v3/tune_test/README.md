## Overview

This repository contains a test implementation of Linear Quadratic Regulator (LQR) tuning. It provides modified scripts (run.py) that log relevant state data and control outputs during execution, and automatically generate corresponding performance diagrams for analysis.

To utilise this version, simply substitute run.py and controller.py in the main folder (main/Linear_Quadratic_Regulator).
